            API Overview

An API (Application Programming Interface) connects several software programs allowing them to converse and exchange information. APIs are essential in modern software development as they are an application's backend architecture.

            API Methods

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods specify the action to be taken on a resource. The following are the most often used API development methods:

    GET:

Requests information from a server. When a client submits a GET request, it is requesting data from the server.

    POST:

Sends data to the server for processing. When a client submits a POST request, it is often delivering data to the server to create or update a resource.

    PUT:

Updates server data. When a client submits a PUT request, the resource indicated in the request is updated.

    DELETE:

A client sending a DELETE request is asking for the removal of the specified resource.

    Client and Server

- The client is most of the time the front application that will send a request using the api methods above to the server.e.g a web site, an app, etc.

- The Server on the other hand is just the back-end application in charge of processing the clien requests and sending back a response. The response is the message the client or front-end application is going to receive.
